# Overture Developer Tutorials 

This repository holds auxiliary projects with exercises and tutorials for new
Overture Developers. These projects support the Overture developer guides and
are not meant to be used on their own.

To use these projects, checkout the repository and build the projects with 'mvn
install'. You will get test failures when building but that's intentional.


## More Information

The main Overture repository is at https://github.com/overturetool/overture.

by reading those guides.
