# Overture Developer Tutorials 

This repository holds auxiliary projects with exercises and tutorials for new
Overture Developers. These projects support the Overture developer guides and
are not meant to be used on their own.

To use these projects, clone this repository and build the projects by typing
`mvn install` from the repository root. You will get test failures when
building but that's intentional and will not cause the build to fail. 

Once the projects have been built, they can be imported as Maven projects in Eclipse.


## More Information

The main Overture repository is at https://github.com/overturetool/overture.

by reading those guides.
